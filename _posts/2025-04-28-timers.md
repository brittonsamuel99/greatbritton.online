The timer has been a feature on nearly every tech device that I have ever owned from my first iPod Nano to my current iPhone and Apple Watch. This application is always handy to have around for when there is a specific need for it. For a very long time the need was never consistent and varied greatly for various one-off tasks. However, over this past year I have been using timers for many more tasks and for using a specific technique that helps with my focus and productivity: *the pomodoro technique*.

One thing that I have learned from doing school full-time then working full-time from home is that my focus is not forever. Even if I pressure myself with a long list of tasks that need to be done in a single day, my focus cannot go for that long everyday. What would end up happening is that I would focus up and work until I would lose focus then "take a break" which would end up being a much longer break than I wanted to. So, the problem was that I needed a way to where I can focus on completing tasks and take a break before my mind would lose the focus and as a result lose the productive drive.

The solution that I found that worked great for me is called *the pomodoro technique*. "Pomodoro" is "tomato" in Italian and refers to one of those tomato timers. To use this productivity method, any timer will do just fine.

The method is to break up productive sessions into smaller, manageable chunks and can be adjusted based on what works best for you. For me, I will do a 25 or 30 minute timer and will work for the duration of that time. After the productive time, I will then set a 5 minute timer which is for a break away from whatever I am working on. The important thing for me here is to not be looking at another screen. I feel more recovered and re-energized by the end of the 5 minute time if I do not look at another screen. Sometimes though I will play a video game but most of the time I will get up and walk around a bit, refill my water, etc. Critically, social media is not an effective break.

Through the use of this productivity method, I am more productive and focused for a longer stretch of time. This has become more helpful as I am needing to get more done within a shorter amount of time between work, school, and home.

Also, I found this timer online and it has been an awesome addition to my desk. Just turn it to have the desired timer duration on top and it will start counting down. Turn it on its back and it will pause the time. Being turned on its face and it will zero out the time.
